## WorkFlowy Focus Next Match
- Use F3 to move focus between search results in WorkFlowy
- Use *Ctrl+G* for find next when using the browser's built-in find feature.
- When search is not active, sets focus at beginning of the first child.
- BUG: when a bullet and it's note contain matches, focus next breaks.
